		<h1> How does a computer work?</h1>

		<p> Computers are very complex machines. They use their many different parts to interact 
		with each other to perform its programmed functions. Put simply, a computer takes in data, 
		stores it, and outputs the desired results. However, it isn't really that simple, because 
		there are many process that go on inside a computer that aren't visible to the user. This 
		page will be explaining how a computer works, while referencing different parts opf the 
		computer. You can find images of these parts on the Parts page. </p> 

		
		<h2> Four steps </h2> 
		<p> There are four steps that outline how a computer works; input, memory, processing, and 
		output. We will begin with the first step.</p>
		<h3> Input </h3> 
		<p> Input is the first step, and it is very simple; the computer needs the user to provide it 
		with information to store, process, and output. Computers cannot give themselves commands, and 
		rely on an external source to tell them what to do. Providing input is much like providing 
		someone with directions to do something for the first time; you provide them with &quot; materials &quot;,
		which are data in our case, and instructions, and they will provide you with your desired results, 
		if you gave them the right instructions.  The computer relies on the users to use peripherals, such
		as the mouse, microphone and keyboard, to relay the information into its storage. Another way 
		of getting input is from other forms of software, such as apps that are already downloaded. 
		These applications can transfer data into the computer the same way a user can. Sometimes, this 
		is done in the background of your device. </p>
		<h3> Memory </h3> 
		<p> Once the computer has the information, it stores it in the hard drive, which is also called 
		the hard disk drive, or the fixed drive. The information stays in the hard drive permanently, 
		unlike the other form of storage, the RAM. RAM stands for Random Access Memory, which is also a 
		form of computer storage. However, everything stored in the RAM is lost when the computer is 
		turned off, which is why it’s important to save your work to the Hard Drive frequently. All files 
		are stored on your computer until you want to use them, which leads us to our next step. </p> 
		<h3> Processing </h3> 
		<p> Once the user &quot;requests&quot; the information, the processing part of the cycle starts. The CPU 
		(central processing unit) retrieves the information that was stored in the RAM,  and starts to 
		use the perform the instructions that you have given it. The CPU is capable of doing basic math, 
		input/output operations, and logical operations. However, during this, the CPU reaches high 
		temperatures, which is why the bottom of your laptop may start to heat your lap. When this happens,
		the fan turns on, which is the whirring sound you may sometimes hear inside your computer. This 
		cools the CPU, leaving it a temperature that it can function at and prevent overheating. </p>
		<h3> Output </h3> 
		<p> Once the computer has processed all the information, it projects, or sends it out, to 
		an LCD screen, which could be your phone screen, laptop screen, or desktop display. Other forms 
		of output include printing, or playing music through a speaker. The purpose of output is to send 
		the processed input back to the user.</p>
