		<h2>CPU</h2>
		<img src="Images/CPU.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of CPU"/>
		<p>The CPU stands for the central processing unit. The CPU is essential to every computer because it&rsquo;s the component of a device that 			processes instructions and executes them. Some people refer to it as the brain of a computer. Typically, a CPU is a small square 				embedded in the motherboard secured by a spring. It is accompanied by a heat sink, which prevents it from overheating. The clock speed of a 			CPU is how fast it&rsquo;s able to perform calculations, which is measured in gigahertz (GHz). One gigahertz equals a billion calculations 			per second. This means that one hertz is equal to one calculation. A CPU with higher clock speed is ideal, because this means your device is 			able to run faster and smoother.</p>
		<h2>CD-ROM drive</h2>
		<img src="Images/ROM.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a CD-ROM drive"/>
		<p>A CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read Only Memory) drive operates by using a laser to reflect light off the bottom of the CD or disc. The reflected 			light pulses are read by a photo detector. These incoming pulses are decoded by the microprocessor and then sent as usable data to the rest 			of the computer where it is processed and used.</p>
		<h2>Hard drive</h2>
		<img src="Images/Harddrive.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a hard drive."/>
		<p>The hard drive permanently stores data and information and allows you to retrieve it. It is a non-volatile memory device, meaning that 			memory is saved, regardless of whether the computer is turned on or off. It’s also a secondary storage data, as it stores data until it is  			deleted or overwritten. It%rsquo;s a key hardware device found in all computers. Operating systems, software files and personal files are all 		stored inside the hard drive. </p>
		<h2>RAM</h2>
		<img src="Images/ram.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a RAM."/>
		<p>Also known as primary or main memory, RAM is what allows computers to store information and retrieve it. As its name imply, RAM accesses 			information randomly, while other hardware such as hard drives accesses memory sequentially. This makes RAM fast.
		RAM is considered volatile memory. This means that when the computer&rsquo;s turned off, all information stored in RAM during the time the 			computer was on will  be lost</p>
		<h2>Motherboard</h2>
		<img src="Images/motherboard.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a motherboard"/>
		<p>At the foundation of every computer is the motherboard, a printed circuit board. The motherboard is a complex board with a multitude of 			other components. The motherboard has expansion slots, which enables an expansion card to be installed like a video card. However, expansion 			slots are only available on desktops, not laptops.</p>
		<h2>Power Supply</h2>
		<img src="Images/Powersupply.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a power supply"/>
		<p>The power supply unit (PSU) converts the AC voltage to DC, and supplies it to the computer. This device is
		what allows the computer to run, as it gives it the power and energy it needs to do everything it does.</p>
		<h2>Heat Sink</h2>
		<img src="Images/heatSink.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a heat sink"/>
		<p>The heat sink is a device that&rsquo;s purpose is to absorb excess, or unwanted heat. If not implemented along with then fan cooling 			system, the computer could overheat which could permenantly damage the computer</p>
		<h2>Fan Cooling System</h2>
		<img src="Images/fan.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a cooling fan system"/>
		<p>The purpose of the cooling fan, much like the heat cage, is to cool the system unit down, and prevent overheating. It draws cool air from 
		the outside to dispel the warm air inside the computer </p>
		<h2>Floppy Disc Drive</h2>
		<img src="Images/floppyDrive.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a floppy disc drive"/>
		<p> A floppy disk drive reads and writes data from a floppy disc to a small, circular piece of metal-coated plastic similar to audio cassette 		tape.</p>
		<h2>Card Cage</h2>
		<img src="Images/cardCage.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a Card Cage"/>
		<p>A card cage is a frame for holding circuit cards such as video and RAM cards.</p>
		<h2>Blower</h2>
		<img src="Images/blower.jpg" width=400 height=300 alt="Picture of a blower"/>
		<p>The blower is a fan directed at the CPU to prevent it from overheating. It takes in cool air to dispel warm air inside.</p>
